      <h3>Quotient Groups</h3>
      <p>
        In the previous section we exhibited a bijection between the left cosets of the kernel \(H\) of a homomorphism  and its image. The group structure on the image allows us to define a group structure on the cosets. Namely, \(aH \cdot bH = abH\).
      </p>
      <p>
      For a general subgroup \(H\) of \(G\), there does not exist a similar group structure on the cosets. In particular, if \(aha^{-1} \notin H\) for some \(h \in H\), then
      \[ ah \in aH \textrm{ and } a^{-1}e \in a^{-1}H \textrm{, but } (ah)(a^{-1}e) = aha^{-1} \notin eH = H. \]
      </p>
      <p>
        If we assume that \(H\) is normal, however, then we do get a group structure:
	\[ (aH)(bH) = a(Hb)H = a(bH)H = abHH = abH. \]
	(Note that normality implies \(bH = Hb\)).
      </p>
      <p>
        With this group structure, we call the set of cosets of a normal subgroup \(H\) in \(G\) a <strong>quotient group</strong>, and denote it \(G/H\). A natural surjective group homomorphism \(\pi \colon G \to G/H\) maps \(a \mapsto aH\) and has kernel \(H\). So every normal subgroup is the kernel of a homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
      As previously noted, the left cosets of \(\textrm{ker }f\) are in bijection with the image of \(f\). In other words, if \(H = \textrm{ker f}\), then \(\vert G/H \vert = \vert \textrm{im } f \vert\). We now show that these groups are isomorphic. Define the map \(\bar{f} \colon G/H \to \textrm{im } f\) by \(\bar{f} (aH) = f(a)\). Then
      \[ \bar{f} (abH) = f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = \bar{f} (aH)\bar{f} (bH). \]
      Thus \(G/H \simeq \textrm{ im } f\). And if \(f\) is surjective, \(G/H \simeq G' \). This result is called the <strong>first isomorphism theorem</strong>.

        Examples:
        <ol>
	  <li>The determinant is a surjective homomorphism \(GL_{n}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}^{\times}\) with kernel \(SL_{n}(\mathbb{R})\). So the quotient \(GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})/SL_{n}(\mathbb{R})\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^{\times}\).  </li>
	  <li>The homomorphism \(f \colon \mathbb{C}^{\times} \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}\) with \(f(z) = z^{2}\) has kernel \(\{\pm 1\}\). Thus \(\mathbb{C}^{\times}/\{\pm 1\} \simeq \mathbb{C}^{\times}\).</li>
