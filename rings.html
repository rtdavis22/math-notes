      <h3>Rings</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>ring</strong> is a set \(R\) with binary operations addition and multiplication satisfying the following properties:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Under addition, \(R\) is an abelian group. Its identity is denoted 0.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Multiplication is associative and has an identity called 1:
            <ul>
	      <li>For all \(a, b, c\) in \(R\), \((ab)c = a(bc)\).</li>
	      <li>For all \(a\) in \(R\), \(a1 = 1a = a\).</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
          <li>
            Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. For all \(a, b, c\) in \(R\),
	    <ul>
		    <li>\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\)</li>
		    <li>\((b + c)a = ba + ca\)</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If multiplication is commutative, the ring is called a commutative ring. Since these are the primary object of our study, we assume rings are commutative unless otherwise noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>subring</strong> of a ring \(R\) is a subset of \(R\) that is itself a ring when addition and multiplication in \(R\) are restricted to the subset, and which shares the same multiplicative identity as \(R\).
      <p>
        Examples of rings:
	<ol>
          <li>
            The complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) form a ring, with subrings \(\mathbb{R}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), and \(\mathbb{Z}\).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The Gaussian integers \(\mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}i\) form a ring which is also a subring of \(\mathbb{C}\).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) is a ring for any \(n > 0\).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If \(R\) is a ring, then the set of polynomials in a variable \(x\) over \(R\) forms a ring denoted \(R[x]\):
	    \[ R[x] = \{a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dotsb + a_nx^n \mid a_i \in R\}. \]
	    It follows that polynomials in variables \(x\) and \(y\) form a ring, since \(R[x][y]\) is a ring. This ring is also denoted \(R[x, y]\).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The <strong>zero ring</strong> is the ring that only contains the element 0. This is the only ring in which \(1 = 0\).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    A field is a ring in which every element has a multiplicative inverse.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
              For any abelian group \((A, +, 0)\), the set of homomorphisms from \(A\) to itself forms a ring called the endomorphism ring of \(A\), or End(\(A\)). These rings are usually non-commmutative.
	      <ul>
	        <li>
		  Addition of homomorphisms \(f\) and \(g\) is defined pointwise:
	          \[ (f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a). \]
		  The additive identity is the homomorphism with \(0(a) = 0\).
	        </li>
	        <li>
		  Multiplication of homomorphisms \(f\) and \(g\) is defined as composition of homomorphisms:
		  \[ (fg)(a) = f(g(a)). \]
  		  The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism \(1(a) = a\).
	        </li>
	      </ul>
	      The elements which have multiplicative inverses are the isomorphisms.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The zero ring is the endomorphism ring of the zero group.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The ring of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) is the endomorphism ring of the group \(\mathbb{Z}\) under addition. Any homomorphism \(f \colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) is completely determined by the integer \(f(1)\), and we can bijectively identify homomorphisms with integers in this way.
