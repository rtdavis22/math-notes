    We know that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is not a principal ideal domain, but it turns out that it is still a unique factorization domain.
    In fact, if \(R\) is any domain with unique factorization, then so is \(R[x]\).
    We prove that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) has unique factorization below.

    A <em>primitive</em> polynomial is defined to be a polynomial with integer coefficients,
    where the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is 1 and the leading coefficient is positive.
    Every polynomial \(f(x)\) of positive degree with rational coefficients can be written uniquely as a product \(f(x) = cf_0(x)\),
    where \(c \in \mathbb{Q}^\times\) (called the <em>content</em>) and \(f_0(x)\) is a primitive polynomial.
    Moreover, \(c\) is an integer if and only if \(f(x)\) is an integer polynomial.

      Suppose that a prime \(p\) divides \(f_0(x)g_0(x)\), where \(f_0(x)\) and \(g_0(x)\) are primitive. That is, \(p\) divides all coefficients of \(f_0(x)g_0(x)\).
      Consider the homomorphism \(\psi_p \colon \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{F}_p[x]\) mapping polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) to polynomials with coefficients reduced modulo \(p\).
      Since \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) is an integral domain, \(\psi_p(f_0)\) or \(\psi_p(g_0)\) must be 0.
      This implies that \(p\) divides \(f_0\) or \(g_0\), which is a contradiction.

    Since \(\mathbb{Q}\) is a field, \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\) is a unique factorization domain.
    So \(f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\) can be written uniquely as \(f(x) = cp_1(x) \dotsb p_k(x)\), where \(p_1, \dotsc, p_k\) are monic irreducible polynomials.
    Write each of these irreducible polynomials as the product of a content and a primitive polynomial:
    \[
    \begin{aligned} f(x) = cp_1(x) \dotsb p_k(x) &= cc_1q_1(x) \dotsb c_kq_k(x) \\
    &= cc_1 \dotsb c_kq_1(x) \dotsb q_k(x) \\ &= dq_1(x) \dotsb q_k(x) , \end{aligned}
    \]
    where \(q_1, \dotsc, q_k\) are primitive and irreducible and \(d \in \mathbb{Q}^\times\).
    (They are irreducible because they are multiples of irreducible polynomials.)
    For example, if \(p_1(x) = x + \frac{1}{2}\), then \(c_1 = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(q_1(x) = 2x + 1\).
  </p>
  <p>
    Applying Gauss's Lemma, we find that \(q_1(x) \dotsb q_k(x)\) is primitive.
    This implies that \(d = cc_1 \dotsb c_k\) is an integer if \(f(x)\) is an integer polynomial.
    Thus a factorization of an integer polynomial \(f(x)\) can be given as \(f(x) = p_1 \dotsb p_l \cdot q_1(x) \dotsb q_k(x)\),
    where \(p_1 \dotsb p_l\) is the prime factorization of \(d\) and \(q_1, \dotsc, q_k\) are irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\).
    A little more work shows that this factorization is unique and hence that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is a unique factorization domain.

    The homomorphism \(\psi_p\) exhibited previously is also useful for determining if an integer polynomial is irreducible, as the following result shows.

    Let \(f(x)\) be an integer polynomial and \(p\) be a prime which doesn't divide its leading coefficient.
    If \(\psi_p(f)\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\), then \(f\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\).

      We prove the contrapositive: if \(f\) is reducible, then \(\psi_p(f)\) is reducible.
      Let \(f = gh\), where \(g\) and \(h\) have positive degree, and let \(p\) be a prime that doesn't divide the leading coefficient of \(f\).
      We have \(\textrm{deg }f = \textrm{deg }g + \textrm{deg }h\) and \(\textrm{deg }f = \textrm{deg }\psi_p(f)\).
      Since \(\psi_p\) is a homomorphism, \(\psi_p(f) = \psi_p(g)\psi_p(h)\), so \(\textrm{deg }\psi_p(f) = \textrm{deg }\psi_p(g) + \textrm{deg }\psi_p(h)\).
      Since the degree of the image of a polynomial under \(\psi_p\) is at most the degree of the polynomial,
      we must have \(\textrm{deg }\psi_p(g) = \textrm{deg }g\) and \(\textrm{deg }\psi_p(h) = \textrm{deg }h\).
      This shows that \(\psi_p(f)\) is reducible.

    Since there are only finitely many polynomials in \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\), this is a convenient way of showing that a polynomial in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is irreducible.
    For example, \(f(x) = x^3 + x + 1\) is irreducible because \(\psi_2(f)\) has no roots in \(\mathbb{F}_2\).
    The polynomial \(f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + 1\) is also irreducible.
    It doesn't have a root in \(\mathbb{F}_2\) so it doesn't factor as the product of a degree 1 and a degree 3 polynomial in \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]\).
    And the only irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]\) is \(x^2 + x + 1\), and its square is not \(f(x)\).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this technique does not always work.
    There are irreducible integer polynomials that can be factored modulo every prime \(p\).
    The polynomial \(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\) is an example.
