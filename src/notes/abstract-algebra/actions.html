      An <strong>action</strong> of a group \(G\) on a set \(S\) is a map \(G \times S \to S\) that satisfies two properties:
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>Identity: \(es = s\) for all \(s \in S\)</li>
      <li>Associativity: \((gg')s = g(g's)\) for all \(g, g' \in G\) and \(s \in S\)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>orbit</strong> of an element \(s \in S\) is the set of elements in \(S\) that can be reached by the group action:
      \[ O_{s} = \{s' \in S \mid s' = gs \textrm{ for some } g \in G\}. \]
      The orbits of a group action partition the set \(S\) via the equivalence relation
      \[ s \sim s' \textrm{ if } s' = gs \textrm{ for some } g \in G. \]
      If \(S\) consists of just one orbit, the action is said to be <strong>transitive</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>stabilizer</strong> of an element \(s \in S\) is the subgroup of \(G\) that leaves \(s\) fixed:
      \[ G_{s} = \{g \in G \mid gs = s\}. \]
    </p>
    <span>
      Some examples of group actions:
    </span>
    <ol>
      <li>The symmetric group \(S_{n}\) acts transitively on any set with \(n\) elements by permuting the elements of the set. The stabilizer of any element is isomorphic to the subgroup \(S_{n - 1}\).</li>
      <li>
        <p>Let \(M_{2}\) be the group of all isometries of the plane, the maps \(\mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}\) that preserve distances.</p>
        <p>This group acts transitively on the set of points in the plane. The stabilizer of the origin is \(O(2)\), the orthogonal group in dimension 2.</p>
        <p>If \(S\) is the set of triangles in the plane, then the orbit of a given triangle is the set of triangles congruent to it. This is not a transitive action. The stabilizer of a given triangle is isomorphic to the dihedral group \(D_{3}\).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Let \(G\) be any group and \(H \subset G\). Denote the set of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) by \(G/H\), copying the notation used for quotient groups. The group \(G\) acts on \(G/H\) using the map \(g(aH) \mapsto gaH\).</p>
        <p>Since the coset \(eH\) can be mapped to any other coset, there must be only one orbit. Thus the action is transitive.</p>
        <p>
          The stabilizer of a coset \(aH\) is a conjugate of the subgroup \(H\):
          \[ G_{aH} = \{g \mid g(aH) = aH\} = aHa. \]
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally, for any group action, the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate: if \(s' = gs\), then
          \[ G_{s'} = gG_{s}g^{-1}. \]
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We now show how the orbit and stabilizer of an element are related. Suppose \(s' = gs\). Then the map \(O_{s} \to G/G_{s}\) defined by
      \[ s' = gs \mapsto gG_{s} \]
      is a bijection. It is surjective since for any \(g \in G\), the element \(s' = gs\) is in \(O_{s}\). Now \(gG_{s} = hG_{s}\) if and only if \(h^{-1}g \in G_{s}\) if and only if \(gs = hs\), so the map is injective.
      It follows that \(\vert O_{s} \vert = \vert G/G_{s} \vert\) for any \(s \in S\). This result is called the <strong>orbit-stabilizer theorem</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall the counting formula (using \(\vert G/H \vert\) instead of \([G \colon H]\)):
      \[ \vert G \vert = \vert H \vert \vert G/H \vert .\]
      Combining this with the previous result, we have a new counting formula: if \(S\) is a finite set on which a group \(G\) acts, then
      \[ \vert G \vert = \vert G_{s} \vert \vert O_{s} \vert .\]
    </p>
    <p>
      Some applications of the counting formula:
    <ol>
      <li>We said before that the action of \(S_{n}\) that permutes the elements of an \(n\)-element is transitive (so that \(\vert O_{s} \vert = n\)), and that the stabilizers are isomorphic to \(S_{n - 1}\), so \(\vert G_{s} \vert = \vert S_{n -
        1}
        \vert \). Then \(\vert S_{n} \vert = \vert G_{s} \vert \vert O_{s} \vert = \vert S_{n - 1} \vert \cdot n\). </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can use this counting formula to classify the finite subgroups \(G\) of \(SO(3)\) that preserve the regular solids in \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\).
          Euler's rotation theorem says that every \(g \in G\) is rotation around an axis. So we need to look for structure-preserving rotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let \(T\) be the group of rotational symmetries of the regular tetrahedron. Clearly \(T\) is some subgroup of \(S_{4}\), since the action of the group permutes the vertices. We first use this action to compute the order of \(T\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the line connecting any vertex with the center of the triangle on the opposite side. There are 3 rotations about this axis that preserve the vertex: the identity, rotation by \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), and rotation by \(\frac{4\pi}{3}\). So
          the stabilizer of a vertex \(G_{v}\) has order 3. Since any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex, the action is transitive, so \( \vert O_{v} \vert = \#V = 4\). Then we have
          \[ \vert T \vert = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 . \]
        </p>
        <p>
          We could have also computed \(\vert T \vert\) by considering the actions on the edges and faces:
          \[ \begin{aligned} \vert T \vert &= \vert G_{e} \vert \vert O_{e} \vert = 2 \cdot \#E = 2 \cdot 6 \\ &= \vert G_{f} \vert \vert O_{f} \vert = 3 \cdot \#F = 3 \cdot 4. \end{aligned} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This group is actually \(A_{4}\). The 8 elements which represent rotations about a vertex are the permutations with order 3:
          \[ (234), (243), (134), (143), (124), (142), (123) \textrm{, and } (132). \]
          Taking the axes through pairs of opposite edges and rotating by \(\pi\) gives the rotations that represent the 3 permutations of order 2:
          \[ (12)(34), (13)(24) \textrm{, and } (14)(23). \]
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar process shows that the group which preserves the octahedron and the cube (its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron">dual</a>) has order 24. This group is \(S_{4}\): it permutes the 4 internal diagonals of the
          cube.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also the group which preserves the icosahedron and dodecahedron (its dual) has order 60. This group is \(A_{5}\), but it's not obvious how to identify the permutations with their corresponding rotations.
