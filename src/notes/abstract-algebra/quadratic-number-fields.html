      An <strong>algebraic number</strong> is a complex number that is a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. The kernel of the substitution homomorphism \(\varphi \colon \mathbb{Q}[x] \to \mathbb{C}\) that sends \(x\) to an algebraic number \(\alpha\) is a principal ideal (as are all ideals of \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\)), generated by the monic polynomial of least degree that has \(\alpha\) as a root. This polynomial is called the irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
      </p>
      <p>
      An algebraic number is an <strong>algebraic integer</strong> if its monic irreducible polynomial over \(\mathbb{Q}\) has integer coefficients. For example, the cube root of unity \(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3} = \frac{1}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{-3})\) is an algebraic number because its irreducible polynomial over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^2 + x + 1\). The number \(\alpha = \frac{1}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{3})\) is not an algebraic integer because its irreducible polynomial over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^2 - x - \frac{1}{2}\).
      </p>
      <p>
        A rational number is an algebraic integer if and only if it is an ordinary integer. This is true because the irreducible polynomial over \(\mathbb{Q}\) for a rational number \(a\) is \(x - a\).
      </p>
      <p>
      A <strong>quadratic number field</strong> is a field of the form \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]\), where \(d\) is a fixed integer which is not a square. We also assume that \(d\) is square-free since otherwise we could pull the square out of the radical. If \(d > 0\) we say it's a real quadratic number field, and if \(d \lt 0\) we say it's an imaginary quadratic number field.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'd like to determine the algebraic integers in \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]\). Let \(\alpha = a + b\sqrt{d}\) be an element of \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]\) that is not in \(\mathbb{Q}\) (i.e. \(b \neq 0\)), and let \(\alpha' = a - b\sqrt{d}\). Then \(\alpha\) and \(\alpha'\) are roots of the polynomial
        \[ (x - \alpha)(x - \alpha') = x^2 - 2ax + (a^2 - b^2d), \]
        which has rational coefficients. Since \(\alpha\) is not rational, it is not the root of a linear polynomial. So this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\). It follows that \(\alpha\) is an algebraic integer if and only if \(2a\) and \(a^2 - b^2d\) are ordinary integers. From this it's clear that \(a\) must either be an integer or a half-integer for \(\alpha\) to be an algebraic integer.
      </p>
      <p>
      If \(a\) is an integer, then \(b^2d\) must be an integer. Then \(b\) is an integer. (If it weren't, then \(b^2d\) would have a square in the denominator.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume \(a\) is the half-integer \(m + \frac{1}{2}\). Then \(a^2 = m^2 + m + \frac{1}{4}\) is in the set \(\mathbb{Z} + \frac{1}{4}\). So \(4b^2d\) is an integer and by the same reasoning as the previous case, \(2b\) is an integer. It follows that \(b\) is a half-integer, and \(b^2d\) is in the set \(\mathbb{Z} + \frac{1}{4}\) if and only if \(d \equiv 1\) modulo 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        To summarize the preceding discussion, the algebraic integers in the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]\), with \(d\) square-free, have the form \(\alpha = a + b\sqrt{d}\), where
	<ul>
	  <li>If \(d \equiv 2\) or \(d \equiv 3\) modulo 4, then \(a\) and \(b\) are integers.</li>
	  <li>If \(d \equiv 1\) modulo 4, then \(a\) and \(b\) are either both integers or both half-integers.</li>
	</ul>
	These algebraic integers can be shown to form a ring called the <strong>ring of integers</strong> in the field \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]\). If \(d\) is 2 or 3 modulo 4, this ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\). If \(d\) is 1 modulo 4, the ring can be written \(\mathbb{Z}[\eta]\), where \(\eta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{d})\).
      </p>
      <p><strong>II.</strong></p>
      <p>
      Let \(R\) denote the ring of integers in a quadratic number field. Define the norm map \(N \colon R \to \mathbb{Z}\) by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - b^2d = (a + b\sqrt{d})(a - b\sqrt{d})\). This map has the multiplicative property \(N(\beta\gamma) = N(\beta)N(\gamma)\). This property gives us control of the factors of an element \(\alpha = \beta\gamma\) since we only need to check elements \(\beta\) whose norm divides the norm of \(\alpha\).
      </p>
      <p>
        An element \(\alpha\) is a unit in \(R\) if an only if \(N(\alpha)\) is a unit in \(\mathbb{Z}\).
	<br />
	<i>Proof: </i>If \(\alpha\) is a unit, then \(N(\alpha)N(\alpha^{-1}) = N(1) = 1\), so \(N(\alpha)\) must be \(\pm 1\). If \(N(\alpha) = \alpha\bar{\alpha} = \pm 1\), then either \(\bar{\alpha}\) or \(-\bar{\alpha}\) is an inverse for \(\alpha\).
      </p>
      <p>
      If \(d > 0\), it can be shown that the unit group of \(R\) is infinite. For example, if \(d = 5\), then the golden ratio \(\frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{5})\) has norm -1 and all of its positive integer powers are distinct and have norm \(\pm 1\).
      </p>
      <p>
      Now we examine the units when \(d \lt 0\).
      In this case, a norm of -1 is not possible, so we are looking for solutions to the equation \(N(\alpha) = a^2 - b^2d = 1\),
      where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers or half-integers.
      If \(b = 0\), then \(a = \pm 1\) are solutions.
      If \(b \neq 0\) and \(d \lt -1\), we must have \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(-b^2d = \frac{3}{4}\),
      where \(b\) is a half-integer and \(d\) is 1 modulo 4.
      If \(d \lt -3\), this equation has no solutions.
      If \(d = -3\), there are 4 solutions: \(\pm\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-3}\).
      Finally, if \(d = -1\), the four powers of \(i\) are solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To recap, if \(R\) is the ring of integers in an imaginary quadratic number field, then
	<ul>
	  <li>The units of \(R\) are \(\pm 1\) unless \(d = -1\) or \(d = -3\).</li>
	  <li>If \(d = -1\), \(R\) is the ring of Gaussian integers, and the units are the four powers of \(i\).</li>
	  <li>If \(d = -3\), the units are the six powers of \(e^{2\pi i/6} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sqrt{-3})\).</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Factoring terminates in the ring of integers in an imaginary quadratic number field because factoring terminates in the integers: if \(\alpha = \beta\gamma\) is a proper factorization in \(R\), then \(N(\alpha) = N(\beta)N(\gamma)\) is a proper factorization in \(\mathbb{Z}\). However, \(R\) is usually not a unique factorization domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        If \(d \equiv 3\) modulo 4, then \(R\) is not a unique factorization domain when \(d \lt -1\). In this case, the element \(1 - d\) can be factored in two ways:
	\[ 1 - d = (1 + \sqrt{d})(1 - \sqrt{d}) = 2\cdot\frac{1 - d}{2}. \]
	Note that 2 is an irreducible element. Otherwise there would exist an element in \(R\) whose norm is more than one and also divides 4, the norm of 2. But no element has norm 2 when \(d \lt -1\). The factorization cannot be unique since 2 does not divide \((1 + \sqrt{d})\) or \((1 - \sqrt{d})\): \(\frac{1}{2}(1 \pm \sqrt{d})\) is not an element of \(R\).
      </p>
      <p>
      Similarly, when \(d \equiv 2\) modulo 4 and \(d \lt -2\), \(R\) does not have unique factorization because \(4 - d\) can be factored as \((2 - \sqrt{d})(2 + \sqrt{d})\) or \(2\cdot\frac{4-d}{2}\), where 2 is irreducible and does not divide \(2 \pm \sqrt{d}\).
      </p>
      <p>
      This reasoning breaks down when \(d \equiv 1\) modulo 4, and in fact there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark%E2%80%93Heegner_theorem">several such imaginary quadratic fields</a> in which the ring of integers has unique factorization.

        Definition of Dedekind domain
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring of integers in a quadratic number field is a Dedekind dommain. Any PID is also a Dedekind domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every ideal in a Dedekind domain can be uniquely factored as the product of prime ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class group as a measure of how far a Dedekind domain is from being a PID.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideal classes of a Dedekind domain R, Cl(R), form a group with ideal class multiplication defined as \(\langle I \rangle \langle J \rangle = \langle IJ \rangle\).
      </p>
      <p>
        For a Dedekind domain R, R is a PID if and only if Cl(R) is the trivial group.
