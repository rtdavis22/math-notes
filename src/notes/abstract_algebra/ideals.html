      <h3>Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>ring homomorphism</strong> is a map \(f \colon R \to R'\) that preserves the structure of the ring:
	\[ f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) \textrm{, } \hspace{10 pt} f(ab) = f(a)f(b) \textrm{, } \hspace{10 pt} \textrm{and} \hspace{10 pt} f(1) = 1. \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The kernel of \(f\) is the set of elements in \(R\) that map to 0 in \(R'\):
	\[ \textrm{ker } f = \{a \in R \mid f(a) = 0\}. \]
	Note that this is also the kernel of the group homomorphism between the additive groups \(R\) and \(R'\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The kernel of a group homomorphism is not only a subgroup but a normal subgroup. Similarly, the kernel of a ring homomorphism has a property stronger than closure under multiplication:
	\[ \textrm{if } a \in \textrm{ker } f\textrm{, then } rs \in \textrm{ker } f \textrm{ for all } r \in R. \]
	This property is abstracted in the concept of an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <strong>ideal</strong> \(I\) of a ring \(R\) is a non-empty subset of \(R\) with these properties:
	<ul>
	  <li>\(I\) is closed under addition.</li>
	  <li>If \(a\) is in \(I\) and \(r\) is in \(R\), then \(rs\) is in \(I\).</li>
	</ul>
        So the kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal. And similar to normal subgroups, we will see later that every ideal is the kernel of a natural ring homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        More examples of ideals:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <p>The zero set \(\{0\}\) is an ideal of any ring \(R\). It is the kernel of the identity map on \(R\).</p>
	    <p>The full ring \(R\) is also an ideal. It is the kernel of the homomorphism taking everything to 0.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      In any ring \(R\), the multiples of a single element \(a\) form an ideal called the <strong>principal ideal</strong> generated by \(a\), also denoted \((a)\):
	      \[ (a) = \{ra \mid r \in R\}. \]
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The ring \(R\) is the principal ideal \((1)\), also called the unit ideal. This is the only ideal that contains 1. The principal ideal \((0)\) only contains 0, and is called the zero ideal.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>The only ideals of the integers are principal ideals. This is true since all subgroups have the form \(n\mathbb{Z}\).</p>
	    <p>For any ring \(R\), there is a canonical ring homomorphism \(f \colon \mathbb{Z} \to R\) that is completely determined by the fact that \(f(1) = 1\). For example, if \(R\) is \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), \(\mathbb{R}\), or \(\mathbb{C}\), then \(\textrm{ker }f = 0\mathbb{Z} = \{0\}\). And if \(R = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\), then \(\textrm{ker }f = n\mathbb{Z}\).</p>
	    <p>If \(R\) is a field, then the kernel of \(f\) is either \((0)\) or \(p\mathbb{Z}\) for a prime \(p\). For if \(\textrm{ker }f = ab\mathbb{Z}\) for \(a,b > 1\), then \(f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = 0\) implies \(f(a)\) or \(f(b)\) is 0, since we can multiply by their multiplicative inverses. But this means that \(a\) or \(b\) is in the kernel of \(f\), which is a contradiction.</p>
	    <p>This prime \(p\) is called the <strong>characteristic</strong> of the field. If the kernel is \((0)\), the field has characteristic zero.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>A ring \(R\) has only two ideals \(\{0\}\) and \(R\) if and only if \(R\) is a field.</p>
	    <p>Assume \(R\) is a field and that an ideal \(I \subset R\) is not the zero ideal. Take \(a \in R\) with \(a \neq 0\). Since \(a\) has an inverse \(a^{-1}\), then \(aa^{-1} = 1\) is in \(R\). It follows that \(I = R\).</p>
	    <p>Now assume \(R\) has only two ideals. For any element \(a\) in \(R\), consider the principal ideal \((a)\). Since this isn't the zero ideal, it must be \(R\). In particular, \(1 \in R\). This means that there is some element \(a^{-1}\) with \(aa^{-1} = 1\). In other words, \(a\) has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>The ring \(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\) isn't a field, so we know it has more than two ideals. The principal ideal generated by 2, the only element without a multiplicative inverse, gives the remaining ideal: \((2) = \{0, 2\}\).</p>
	    <p>
	      In general, \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) has a distinct ideal \((d\)) for all \(d \mid n\), and one of these ideals \((d_1)\) contains another ideal \((d_2)\) if \(d_1 \mid d_2\). In particular, \(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}\) has a chain of ideals:
	      \[ (1) \supset (p) \supset (p^2) \supset \dotsb \supset (p^k) = (0). \]
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>Every ideal in the ring \(F[x]\) of polynomials over a field \(F\) is a principal ideal generated by the unique monic polynomial of lowest degree that it contains.</p>
	    <p>Let \(I\) be a non-zero ideal of \(F[x]\). Choose a polynomial \(f\) in \(I\) of least degree. Since \(F\) is a field, we can scale this polynomial to be monic. We claim that \(I = (f)\).</p>
	    <p>Choose any element \(g\) of \(I\) and use division with remainder to write \(g = fq + r\), where \(r\) has lower degree than \(f\). Since \(g\) and \(f\) are in \(I\), \(g - fq = r\) is in \(I\). And since \(f\) has minimal degree, we must have \(r = 0\). Therefore, \(f\) divides \(g\), and \(g\) is in \((f)\).</p>
	    <p>The polynomial \(f\) must be unique. If there were two monic polynomials of least degree, then their difference would have even lesser degree and also be in \(I\). This is a contradiction.</p>
	    <p>The map \(f \colon F[x] \to F\) defined by evaluation at \(c \in F\) is a ring homomorphism. The kernel of \(f\) is the the set of polynomials that vanish at \(c\). If \(c \neq 0\), then the kernel must be the principal ideal \((x - c)\). In other words, if \(g(c) = 0\), then \(g(x) = (x - c)h(x)\) for some polynomial \(h\). This implies that a polynomial of degree \(n\) over a field \(F\) has at most \(n\) roots.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      The map \(f \colon F[x,y] \to F\) defined by evaluation at \((0, 0)\) is an example of a ring homomorphism with a kernel that is not generated by a single element. Namely,
	      \[\textrm{ker } f = (x,y) = \{rx + sy \mid r,s \in R\}.\]
