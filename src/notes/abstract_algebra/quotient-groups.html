      <h3>Quotient Groups</h3>
      <p><strong>I.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Given any subgroup \(H\) of \(G\), an equivalence relation can be defined on \(G\) by
	\[ a \equiv b \textrm{ if } b = ah \textrm{ for some } h \in H. \]
        We briefly check that each of the required properties holds:
	<ul>
	  <li>Transitivity: If \(a \equiv b\) and \(b \equiv c\), then \(b = ah\) and \(c = bh'\) for some \(h\) and \(h'\) in \(H\). Thus, \(c = ahh'\) and \(a \equiv c\).</li>
	  <li>Symmetry: If \(a \equiv b\), then \(b = ah\). So \(a = bh^{-1}\) and \(b \equiv a\).</li>
	  <li>Reflexivity: Since \(a = ae\) and \(e \in H\), then \(a \equiv a\).</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The equivalence classes of this equivalence relation are called the <strong>left cosets</strong> of H in G. If \(a \in H\), then
	\[ aH = \{ah \mid h \in H\} \]
	is a left coset. In particular, \(eH = H\) is one of the cosets.
      </p>
      <p>
	Each left coset \(aH\) can be bijectively identified with \(H\) using the map \(aH \to H\) defined by multiplication on the left by \(a^{-1}\). The map is bijective since it can be inverted with multiplication by \(a\).
	Thus, all left cosets have the same order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of left cosets of a subgroup \(H\) in \(G\) is called the <strong>index</strong> of \(H\) in \(G\) and is denoted \([G \colon H]\).
	Since all left cosets have the same order, we have the <strong>Counting Formula</strong>:
	\[ \vert G \vert = \vert H \vert [G \colon H]. \]
	From this it is clear that the order of \(H\) divides the order of \(G\) if \(G\) is finite. This is called <strong>Lagrange's Theorem</strong>. It follows that the order of any element in \(G\) divides the order of \(G\).
      </p>
      <p>Some examples:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Let \(G\) be a finite group of prime order. Then the only subgroups of \(G\) are \(G\) and \(\{e\}\).  Furthermore, all non-trivial elements of \(G\) generate the group. That is, \(\langle g \rangle = G\) for \(g \neq e\).
	</li>
	<li>
          <p>
	    Let \(H\) be the kernel of a homomorphism \(f \colon G \to G'\). We show that the equivalence relation holds between two elements in \(G\) if and only if they have the same image under \(f\):
	    <ul>
	      <li>Assume \(a \equiv b\). Then \(b = ah\) for some \(h\) in \(H\). Thus,
	      \[ f(b) = f(ah) = f(a)f(h) = f(a). \]
	      </li>
	      <li>Now assume \(f(b) = f(a)\). Then \(f(a^{-1}b) = e'\), so \(a^{-1}b = h\) for some \(h\) in \(H\). It follows that \(b = ah\) and \(a \equiv b\).
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This implies that the left cosets of \(H\) are in bijection with the image of \(f\). So
	    \[ [ G \colon \textrm{ker } f] = \vert \textrm{im } f \vert. \]
	    Combining this result with the Counting Formula, we have
	    \[ \vert G \vert = \vert \textrm{ker } f \vert \cdot \vert \textrm{im } f \vert. \]
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
          The alternating group on \(n\) letters, \(A_{n}\), is by definition the kernel of the homomorphism \(f \colon S_{n} \to \langle \pm 1 \rangle\) defined in the previous section. Using the result from the previous example, we have \(\vert S_{n} \vert = \vert A_{n} \vert \cdot 2\), or \(\vert A_{n} \vert = \frac{n!}{2}\).
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>II.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Example 2 above exhibits a bijection between the left cosets of the kernel \(H\) of a homomorphism  and its image. The group structure on the image allows us to define a group structure on the cosets. Namely, \(aH \cdot bH = abH\).
      </p>
      <p>
      For a general subgroup \(H\) of \(G\), there does not exist a similar group structure on the cosets. In particular, if \(aha^{-1} \notin H\) for some \(h \in H\), then
      \[ ah \in aH \textrm{ and } a^{-1}e \in a^{-1}H \textrm{, but } (ah)(a^{-1}e) = aha^{-1} \notin eH = H. \]
      </p>
      <p>
        If we assume that \(H\) is normal, however, then we do get a group structure:
        \[ (aH)(bH) = a(Hb)H = a(bH)H = abHH = abH. \]
        (Note that normality implies \(bH = Hb\)).
      </p>
      <p>
        With this group structure, we call the set of cosets of a normal subgroup \(H\) in \(G\) a <strong>quotient group</strong>, and denote it \(G/H\). A natural surjective group homomorphism \(\pi \colon G \to G/H\) maps \(a \mapsto aH\) and has kernel \(H\). So every normal subgroup is the kernel of a homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
      As previously noted, the left cosets of \(\textrm{ker }f\) are in bijection with the image of \(f\). In other words, if \(H = \textrm{ker f}\), then \(\vert G/H \vert = \vert \textrm{im } f \vert\). We now show that these groups are isomorphic. Define the map \(\bar{f} \colon G/H \to \textrm{im } f\) by \(\bar{f} (aH) = f(a)\). Then
      \[ \bar{f} (abH) = f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = \bar{f} (aH)\bar{f} (bH). \]
      Thus \(G/H \simeq \textrm{im } f\). And if \(f\) is surjective, \(G/H \simeq G' \). This result is called the <strong>first isomorphism theorem</strong>. Note that \(f = \bar{f} \circ \pi\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
        <ol>
          <li>The determinant is a surjective homomorphism \(GL_{n}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}^{\times}\) with kernel \(SL_{n}(\mathbb{R})\). So the quotient \(GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})/SL_{n}(\mathbb{R})\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^{\times}\).  </li>
          <li>The homomorphism \(f \colon \mathbb{C}^{\times} \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}\) with \(f(z) = z^{2}\) has kernel \(\{\pm 1\}\). Thus \(\mathbb{C}^{\times}/\{\pm 1\} \simeq \mathbb{C}^{\times}\).</li>
