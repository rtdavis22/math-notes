        Let \(I\) be an ideal of a ring \(R\). Since \(R\) is an additive group and \(I\) is a normal subgroup, the set of cosets \(R/I\) is a group under addition. We can define a ring structure on \(R/I\) by defining multiplication as
	\[ (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I, \]
	where \(0 + I = I\) is the additive identity and \(1 + I\) is the multiplicative identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This multiplication is well-defined. If \(a + i \in a + I\) and \(b + j \in b + I\), then
	\[ (a + i)(b + j) = ab + (aj + bi + ij), \]
	which is in the coset \(ab + I\). With addition and multiplication defined, the ring axioms can be verified to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this structure, \(R/I\) is called a <strong>quotient ring</strong>. The canonical map \(\pi \colon R \to R/I\) defined by \(r \mapsto r + I\) is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel \(I\).
      </p>
      <p>
      And given a ring homomorphism \(f \colon R \to R'\), we have \(R/\textrm{ker }f \simeq \textrm{im }f\). This is called the <strong>first isomorphism theorem</strong> for rings and can be proved using the same mapping \(\bar{f} \colon R/\textrm{ker }f \to \textrm{im }f\) that was used to prove the first isomorphism theorem for groups, under which \(f = \bar{f} \circ \pi\).

	  <p>If the only ideals \(J\) with \(I \subset J \subset R\) are \(I\) and \(R\), then the quotient \(R/I\) has only two ideals and is thus a field. In this case, \(I\) is said to be a <strong>maximal ideal</strong>.</p>

	  <p>The ring homomorphism \(\mathbb{R}[x] \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by evaluation at 0 has kernel \((x)\) and is surjective. So \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x) \simeq \mathbb{R}\).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) can be defined as the quotient \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1)\). Each real number \(a\) is identified with the coset \(a + (x^2 + 1)\) and \(i\) is defined to be the coset \(x + (x^2 + 1)\). From this definition it's clear that \(i^2 + 1 = 0\).
