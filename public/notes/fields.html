      <h3>Fields</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>field extension</strong> \(K\) of a field \(F\), denoted \(K / F\), is a field \(F\) contained in \(K\).
	An element \(\alpha\) of \(K\) is <em>algebraic over</em> \(F\) if it is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in \(F\).
	If \(\alpha\) is not algebraic over \(F\), it is called <em>transcendental over</em> \(F\).
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, \(\alpha\) is algebraic over \(F\) if the substitution homomorphism \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\) is non-injective and transcendental over \(F\) if \(\varphi\) is injective.
	If \(\varphi\) is non-injective, then the unique monic polynomial generating the kernel is called the <em>irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(F\)</em>.
	The degree of this polynomial is called the <em>degree of \(\alpha\) over \(F\)</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the irreducible polynomial for \(\sqrt i\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^4 + 1\), and the irreducible polynomial for \(\sqrt i\) over \(\mathbb{Q}(i)\) is \(x^2 - i\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(K\) be an extension field of \(F\). Denote the smallest subfield of \(K\) that contains \(\alpha \in K\) as \(F(\alpha)\).
	This field is isomorphic to the field of fractions of \(F[\alpha]\), the image of the substitution map \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\).
      </p>
      <p>
        If \(\alpha \in K\) is transcendental over \(F\), the map \(F[x] \to F[\alpha]\) is an isomorphism. In this case \(F(\alpha)\) is isomorphic to the field \(F(x)\) of rational functions.
	The field extensions \(F(\alpha)\) are isomorphic for all transcendental elements \(\alpha\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let \(\alpha\) be an element of an extension field \(K / F\) which is algebraic over \(F\), and let \(f\) be the irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(F\).
	Since the ideal \((f)\) is maximal, \(f(x)\) generates the kernel of the substitution map \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\), so \(F[x]\) is isomorphic to the image of \(\varphi\), which is \(F[\alpha]\).
	Since \(F[x]/(f)\) is a field, \(F[x]\) is a field. Thus \(F(\alpha)\) is equal to \(F[\alpha]\).
