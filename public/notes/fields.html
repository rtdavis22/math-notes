      <h3>Fields</h3>
      <p><strong>I.</strong></p>
      <p>
        A <strong>field extension</strong> \(K\) of a field \(F\), denoted \(K / F\), is a field \(K\) which contains \(F\).
	An element \(\alpha\) of \(K\) is <em>algebraic over</em> \(F\) if it is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in \(F\).
	If \(\alpha\) is not algebraic over \(F\), it is called <em>transcendental over</em> \(F\).
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, \(\alpha\) is algebraic over \(F\) if the substitution homomorphism \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\) is non-injective and transcendental over \(F\) if \(\varphi\) is injective.
	If \(\varphi\) is non-injective, then the unique monic polynomial generating the kernel is called the <em>irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(F\)</em>.
	The degree of this polynomial is called the <em>degree of \(\alpha\) over \(F\)</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the irreducible polynomial for \(\sqrt i\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^4 + 1\), and the irreducible polynomial for \(\sqrt i\) over \(\mathbb{Q}(i)\) is \(x^2 - i\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(K\) be an extension field of \(F\). Denote the smallest subfield of \(K\) that contains \(\alpha \in K\) as \(F(\alpha)\).
	This field is isomorphic to the field of fractions of \(F[\alpha]\), the image of the substitution map \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\).
      </p>
      <p>
        If \(\alpha \in K\) is transcendental over \(F\), the map \(F[x] \to F[\alpha]\) is an isomorphism. In this case \(F(\alpha)\) is isomorphic to the field \(F(x)\) of rational functions.
	The field extensions \(F(\alpha)\) are isomorphic for all transcendental elements \(\alpha\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let \(\alpha\) be an element of an extension field \(K / F\) which is algebraic over \(F\), and let \(f\) be the irreducible polynomial for \(\alpha\) over \(F\).
	Since the ideal \((f)\) is maximal, \(f(x)\) generates the kernel of the substitution map \(\varphi \colon F[x] \to K\), so \(F[x]\) is isomorphic to the image of \(\varphi\), which is \(F[\alpha]\).
	Since \(F[x]/(f)\) is a field, \(F[x]\) is a field. Thus \(F(\alpha)\) is equal to \(F[\alpha]\).
      </p>
      <p>
        If an algebraic element \(\alpha\) has degree \(n\) over \(F\), then \((1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n-1})\) is a basis for \(F(\alpha)\) as a vector space over \(F\).

      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the irreducible polynomial for \(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^2 + x + 1\), and \((1, \omega)\) is a basis for \(\mathbb{Q}(\omega)\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
      </p>
      <p>
        From this it follows that a necessary conditions for algebraic elements \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) to generate the same field extension is that they must have the same degree over \(F\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(F\) be a field and let \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) be elements of field extensions \(K/F\) and \(L/F\). Suppose that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are algebraic over \(F\).
	There is an isomorphism of fields \(\sigma \colon F(\alpha) \to F(\beta)\) that is the identity on \(F\) and that sends \(\alpha\) to \(\beta\) if and only if the irreducible polynomials for \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) over \(F\) are equal.

        For example...
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(K\) and \(K'\) be extensions of the same field \(F\). An isomorphism \(\varphi \colon K \to K'\) that restricts to the identity on the subfield \(F\) is called an <em>\(F\)-isomorphism</em>, or an <em>isomorphism of extensions fields</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(\varphi \colon K \to K'\) be an isomorphism of field extensions of \(F\), and let \(f\) be a polynomial with coefficients in \(F\).
	Let \(\alpha\) be a root of \(f\) in \(K\), and let \(\alpha' = \varphi(\alpha)\) be its image in \(K'\).
	Then \(\alpha'\) is also a root of \(f\).
